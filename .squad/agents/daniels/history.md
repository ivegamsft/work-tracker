# Daniels — History

## Project Context

- **Project:** E-CLAT — Employee Compliance and Lifecycle Activity Tracker
- **Owner:** Israel (Izzy)
- **Stack:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Zod, PostgreSQL, Prisma, JWT/bcrypt RBAC
- **Structure:** Monorepo — apps/api, apps/web, apps/admin, packages/shared, data (Prisma)
- **Infra:** Terraform (layered: foundation, platform, application), GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Domain:** Workforce readiness and qualification management for regulated industries

## Current Architecture

- **Backend:** Express monolith with 9 modules (auth, employees, medical, notifications, qualifications, standards, documents, hours, labels) + templates module being added
- **Frontend:** React + Vite SPA with role-based route gating
- **Shared:** packages/shared for TypeScript types
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM, single schema
- **API Pattern:** Router → Validator (Zod) → Service → Prisma → DB
- **Auth:** JWT + bcrypt, 4-tier RBAC (EMPLOYEE, SUPERVISOR, MANAGER, ADMIN)

## Key Architectural Notes

- Monorepo uses npm workspaces
- All modules currently co-deployed as a single Express server
- No feature flag system yet
- No service mesh or inter-service communication
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions (single pipeline)
- Infra layered into foundation/platform/application Terraform
- Route taxonomy: /me/* (self-service), /team/:id/* (supervisor), /standards/*, /reviews/*

## 📌 Wave 3: IaC/Deployment Decomposition (2026-03-17T04:30:00Z)

**Mission:** Decompose 5 infrastructure-as-code specifications into 18 implementation GitHub issues.

**Specs decomposed:**
1. IaC architecture — Terraform layers, service group boundaries, parallel deployments
2. Proof Vault IaC — Key Vault bootstrap, storage accounts, encryption key rotation, zero-knowledge encryption
3. Templates service infrastructure — New compute layer, policy enforcement, status workflow scaling
4. Sharing service infrastructure — File request storage, bandwidth quotas, external access token management
5. CI/CD decomposition — Per-subsystem pipelines, feature flags, deployment safety gates

**Issues created:** 18 (Key Vault bootstrap automation, managed identity wiring, service group compute layers, multi-region strategy, backup/archival storage, CI/CD pipeline separation, monitoring/alerting for compliance workflows, encryption key rotation policies, storage account quotas, network isolation, Azure Container Apps scaling, GitHub Actions subsystem pipelines, etc.)

**Result:** All issues linked to GitHub Project #2; deployment topology clarified.

## Learnings

- Parallel-delivery architecture for E-CLAT should be framed as a **modular monolith evolving into service groups**, not as an immediate microservice rewrite.
- Recommended backend service groups: **Identity Platform (`auth`)**, **Workforce Core (`employees`)**, **Compliance Service (`qualifications`, `medical`, `templates`)**, **Records Service (`documents`, `hours`)**, **Reference Data (`standards`, `labels`)**, **Notification Service (`notifications`)**.
- The best first acceleration step is **pipeline separation before runtime separation**: split CI/CD by subsystem and keep `00-foundation` + `10-data` shared while compute grows into per-service modules.
- Feature flags should start as a **repo-backed shared schema plus environment overrides** with a client-safe bootstrap endpoint, not an external flag service.
- Frontend route taxonomy already trends in the right direction (`/me/*`, `/team/*`, `/standards/*`, `/reviews/*`), but navigation is still constrained by the hard-coded menu in `apps/web/src/components/Layout.tsx`.
- Key architecture files for this domain review: `apps/api/src/index.ts`, `apps/api/src/modules/*`, `apps/web/src/App.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/Layout.tsx`, `data/prisma/schema.prisma`, `infra/layers/*`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- Current workflow/IaC mismatch to remember: `deploy.yml` reads `api_app_name`, while `infra/layers/20-compute/outputs.tf` publishes `api_container_app_name`.
- Izzy values **logical subsystem ownership, rollout safety, and faster independent deployments** over a rewrite narrative.
- GitHub rulesets and classic branch protection are both blocked for the private `ivegamsft/work-tracker` repo until the repository is upgraded or made public; current `gh api` calls return 403 plan restrictions.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is the primary memory file for `@copilot` and now carries the authoritative repo context for modules, compliance guardrails, docs pipeline, and infrastructure expectations.
- Preferred `@copilot` branch naming is `copilot/{issue-number}-{slug}`, but GitHub does not yet expose a dedicated repository setting to force that pattern.
- Key architecture and governance files for this update: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/agents/squad.agent.md`, `docs/README.md`, `apps/api/src/modules/templates/`, `data/prisma/schema.prisma`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## 📌 Team Update (2026-03-16T170500Z — Round 2 Spawned)

**All 4 agents complete:**
- Bunk: audit-safe-expiration (PR #56)
- Daniels: terraform-compute-stubs (PR #57)
- Freamon: api-v1-namespace (PR #55, decision merged)
- Kima: coverage audit (54-71% partial)

**Scribe:** Orchestration logs, decision merge, history updates complete
- **Issue #26 Terraform module stubs (SA-05)**: Created 6 service group compute module stubs (`compute-identity`, `compute-workforce`, `compute-compliance`, `compute-records`, `compute-reference`, `compute-notifications`) under `infra/modules/`. Each module currently references the shared Container App via data source but is structured for future independent extraction with commented resource blocks. The `20-compute` layer now instantiates all 6 modules and exposes service-specific outputs (`identity_service`, `workforce_service`, etc.) containing `service_name`, `health_endpoint`, and `deploy_target`. This establishes the Terraform boundary for future parallel deployment without requiring refactoring downstream consumers. The extraction path is documented in `infra/modules/README.md` with recommended migration order: reference-data → notifications → identity → records → compliance → workforce.
- **Parallel validation lanes implemented** (#36): Created `.github/workflows/parallel-lanes.yml` with 8 subsystem-specific lanes (identity, workforce, compliance, records, reference-data, notifications, web, admin) that run in parallel based on change detection from `dorny/paths-filter`. Each lane validates only its subsystem (typecheck, test, build), drastically reducing feedback time for targeted changes.
- **Reusable workflow patterns**: Created `_shared-node-setup.yml`, `_quality-checks.yml`, and `_build-service-image.yml` as composable CI building blocks for consistent setup across lanes and future services.
- **Artifact promotion infrastructure stub** (#37): Created `infra/layers/30-promotion/` Terraform layer with environment-specific artifact metadata storage, promotion gates (dev/staging/prod), and Log Analytics for audit trails. Strategy is SHA-based immutable tags promoted across environments (sha-abc123 → dev-abc123 → staging-abc123 → prod-abc123).
- **Cascade logic in change detection**: Shared package or Prisma schema changes trigger ALL subsystem lanes (because all depend on shared contracts), while module-specific changes only trigger that lane + shared quality check.
- **Lane ownership documented**: Created `docs/pipeline-lane-ownership.md` to clarify which team owns each lane, what it validates, and when it triggers.
- **Terraform layering pattern solidified**: Layers progress `00-foundation` → `10-data` → `20-compute` → `30-promotion`, with promotion layer instantiated once per environment (dev/staging/prod) using Terraform workspaces.
- **Next steps for artifact promotion**: Add Azure DevOps environment resources, container registry webhooks, artifact signing, and GitHub Actions integration for promotion workflows (tracked as TODOs in main.tf).
- **Key files for pipeline architecture**: `.github/workflows/parallel-lanes.yml`, `.github/workflows/_*.yml` (reusables), `infra/layers/30-promotion/`, `docs/pipeline-lane-ownership.md`.

Dead-letter queue config, retry policies. Abstraction layer enables cloud/on-prem swapping. Terraform layer 10-data module `messaging/`.
- **Issue #115 data-layer-iac.md**: PostgreSQL (relational), Cosmos DB/MongoDB (documents), Azure Storage (blobs), Redis (cache), ADX (telemetry). Tiered: shared single-DB + RLS for SMB, dedicated per-tenant DB for enterprise. Lifecycle policies (Hot → Cool → Archive). Connection string rotation. Migration strategy: dual-write → dual-read → switchover. Row-level security policies. Terraform layer 10-data modules `database/`, `storage/`, `cache/`.

**Specs follow unified structure:**
1. Overview & principles
2. Azure resource topology (cloud) + on-prem alternatives
3. Terraform module structure (matching `infra/layers/00-foundation → 10-data → 20-compute` pattern)
4. Cost estimates per tier
5. Security configuration (network, identity, audit)
6. Networking (traffic flow, DNS)
7. Deployment automation (GitHub Actions, Helm)
8. Implementation checklist (phased)
9. Related documentation cross-refs

**All 5 specs locked to decisions:**
- Decision #1: Tiered Isolation (multi-tenant-iac, data-layer-iac)
- Decision #2: Multi-IdP + SCIM (identity-iac)
- Decision #3: Modular Monolith (multi-tenant-iac)
- Decision #9: Event-Driven: Service Bus + WebSocket (event-driven-iac)
- Decision #10: OTel + ADX + App Insights (monitoring-observability)
- Decision #11: Logical Environments (multi-tenant-iac)

**Key architectural patterns established:**
- Terraform factory pattern for dedicated-tier tenant provisioning
- RLS enforced at database layer (not application) for shared tier
- Abstraction layer for messaging enables cloud/on-prem backend swapping
- Ring deployment with auto-rollback on metric thresholds (canary stage orchestration)
- Private Link for prod (network isolation), service endpoints for dev
- Secret rotation via Key Vault or manual scripts
- Dual-write/dual-read migration strategy for data store evolution

**Estimated implementation effort: 28–36 weeks (all 5 specs in sequence or parallel), broken into 4–6 week phases per spec.**
